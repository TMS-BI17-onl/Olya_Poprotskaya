The task for EmailPromotion was not "not EQUAL", it was "not INCLUDING".
Correct answer:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PersonType) AS DistinctCount
FROM Person.Person
WHERE LastName LIKE 'M%' 
		OR NOT EmailPromotion LIKE '%1%'
    
b) -0.75
You will get incorrect result because of group by. We are selecting max rows with top+order, there's no need to use aggregative function.
Corrrect answer:
SELECT  TOP 3   *
FROM Sales.SpecialOffer
WHERE StartDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2014-01-01'
ORDER BY DiscountPct DESC

e) -0.5
Color is not asked in the select and when we will delete ot from the select, it will also be cancelled in the group by. Now the result is incorrect.
Also, though your solution in WHERE is correct, it would be easier to use IS NOT NULL :) It's all about easy-reading of your code.
