Well done!

In your solution there's no need in merge, you're doing all the calculation in other place.
Solution is very intresting, but the task was still to practise MERGE.
My view of solution:
MERGE INTO res t
USING data_for_merge s ON s.Alex=t.function_name
WHEN MATCHED 
	THEN UPDATE SET function_count=function_count+1
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND Alex IS NOT NULL
	THEN INSERT (function_name, function_count)
	VALUES (Alex, 1);

MERGE INTO res t
USING data_for_merge s ON s.Barbara=t.function_name
WHEN MATCHED 
	THEN UPDATE SET function_count=function_count+1
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND Barbara IS NOT NULL
	THEN INSERT (function_name, function_count)
	VALUES (Carlos, 1);
